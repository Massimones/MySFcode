Source code and examples of application the code EDGRN_SF/EDCMP_SF: a numerical model for the representation of displacement, strain and stress due to single forces embedded in a layered elastic half-space


The code is presented in the work submitted to Computers and Geosciences: "Deformation induced by distributions of single forces in a layered half-space: EDGRN_SF/EDCMP_SF" by Massimo Nespoli, Maria Elina Belardinelli, Marco CalÃ², Anna Tramelli and Maurizio Bonafede.
