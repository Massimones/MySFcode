EFGRN/EFCMP: a numerical model for the representation of displacement, strain and stress due to single forces embedded in a layered elastic half-space


The code is presented in the manuscript submitted to Computers and Geosciences: "Deformation induced by distributions of single forces in a layered half-space: EFGRN/EFCMP" by Massimo Nespoli, Maria Elina Belardinelli, Marco CalÃ², Anna Tramelli and Maurizio Bonafede, Computers & Geosciences.

The three directories contain:

- EFGRN/EFCMP_Source_code -----> Source code
- Examples                      -----> Examples of applications of the code
- Generate_SF_distribution      -----> Scripts generating the distribution of single forces
